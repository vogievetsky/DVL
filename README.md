# DVL

**DVL** is a free functionally reactive library written in JavaScript. DVL is based on the idea that code should automatically be run when the variables that it depends on changes.

DVL consists of three parts:
DVL core – The DVL event dispatcher and miscellaneous helper utilities.
DVL SVG – A collection of functions written on top of  [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) to allow for dynamic visualization with SVG.
DVL HTML – A collection of functions written on top of  [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) and jQuery for creating dynamic HTML components.

The code DVL functionality can be described with the following functions:

**dvl.def**

Creates a wrapped variable that can dispatch events.

		var x = dvl.def(5);
		x.get(); //== 5
		x.set(7);
		x.get(); //== 7
		x.notify();
		
The above example creates a wrapped DVL variable with an initial value of 5. This value can be modified through x.get() and x.set(7). To announce to the rest of the program that x has changed x.notify() can be called.

The null value is used to mark that a variable is invalid. 

**dvl.register**

Registers a function to be called whenever any of the registered listened to objects change as well as announcing what objects the function might modify.

		var a = dvl.def(5);
		var b = dvl.def(12);
		var c = dvl.def(null);

		function calc() {
			var av = a.get();
			var bv = b.get();
			if (av !== null && bv !== null) {
				c.set(Math.sqrt(av*av + bv*bv));
				c.notify();
			} else {
				c.set(null);
				c.notify();
			}
		}

		dvl.register({
			fn: calc,
			listen: [a, b],
			change: [c]
		});

		c.get() //== 13
		
		a.set(3).notify()
		b.set(4).notify()
		c.get() //== 5

The above example ensures that calc will be run when a or b change, updating c.

We must explicitly declare that calc will be changing c. This is important for DVL to calculate the dependency graph and ensure that it is acyclic. Modifying a variable without specifying that it might be modified will raise an error.

**dvl.apply**

The apply function is a short-form for simplifying a common pattern found in DVL.

		var a = dvl.def(5);
		var b = dvl.def(12);

		var c = dvl.apply({
		  args: [a, b],
		  fn: function(av, bv) { 
		    return Math.sqrt(av*av + bv*bv); 
		  }
		});

		c.get() //== 13
		
		a.set(3).notify()
		b.set(4).notify()
		c.get() //== 5
		
The above example is equivalent to the example given for dvl.register.
